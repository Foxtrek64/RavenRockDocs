# Welcome to LuzFaltex Docs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While these pages are considered "always under construction", it is important to note that we are currently busy getting the initial documentation, site feel, branding, and other items up and running. Please be patient while this is happening. Though if you'd like to help out, take a look at our [Contributing Guide](./contribute/index.md).

LuzFaltex has furnished this documentation site to hold information on Raven Rock RP, including its lore, plugin information, help guides, and policies. We post both internal and external documentation on this site in order to improve transparency, promote discussion, and enable contribution to improve these documents.
