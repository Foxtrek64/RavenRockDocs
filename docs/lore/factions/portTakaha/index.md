# Port Takaha

Port Takaha [(listen)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.tewhanake.maori.nz/dictionary/44373.mp3) takes its name from the Maori word for a male [Tui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)), a bird found natively on the continent. It was founded by the Pupuhi-Koi after joining the native tribes in the region into a single cohesive group.

These days, the Pupuhi-koi do not do much with the management of the city. They instead lead that to `name here`, the local dutchy.
