# Factions

Factions are a major driving force, both icly and oocly. They constitute one of the major player-driven story-telling tools. As such, we encourage you to create your own!

## Create a Faction

// TODO: Migrate this to faction plugin info

To create your faction, the first thing you will need to do is pick a name. Names should be in `camelCase`. Here are some examples on how you can convert your name:

| Faction Name | System Name |
|---|---|
| Havana | havana |
| Montréal | montreal |
| Ville de Montréal | villeDeMontreal |

> [!NOTE]
> More information coming soon!

> We're still writing our faction plugin, so things are bound to be changing rapidly in this time. Documentation will be updated as soon as we have a stable release of our faction plugin. You can track progress on the [plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ravenrockrp/GildedEmpire).
